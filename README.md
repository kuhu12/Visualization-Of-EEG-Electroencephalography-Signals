# Visualization-Of-EEG-Electroencephalography-Signals
Research Project -- It involves application of visualization techniques to EEG signals to find the most non-dominant features


The proposed work analyses the biomedical Electroencephalography (EEG) device data using visualization techniques and these 
techniques have potential for extracting information from huge data sets. The presented work includes extraction of visual
patterns using visualization techniques of parallel coordinates,radar plot and corrogram in R. The pattern identification 
task is performed in several stages like outlier removal from EEG. After outlier detection data is divided into manageable 
segments to avoid overcrowding of data points. Then random method is applied to select a segment and identify prominent patterns by
application of visual mapping techniques. The most non-dominant features are identified and removed.The K-star classification accuracy
is calcualted in WEKA after removing most non- dominant features.
